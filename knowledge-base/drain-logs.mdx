You can drain logs of your deployed services to a third-party applications like [Axiom](https://axiom.co/) or [New Relic](https://newrelic.com).

We will support more services in the future, like Signoz, HyperDX, etc.

## How to enable?

Go to your `Server` where you want to enable the `Drain Logs` and click on the `Log Drains` tab.

## Axiom

You need to have a `Dataset` and an `API key` from Axiom. More information [here](https://axiom.co/docs).

## New Relic

You need to have an `License key` from New Relic. More information [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).

<Warning>
  Once you enabled at least one of the `Drain Logs`, you need to `Restart` your
  service to apply the changes.
