## Self-hosted version

For self-hosting Coolify, you need to allow some ports on your firewall.

- For Coolify: `8000` (http), `6001` (websocket) and `22` (SSH, or a custom port) (required)

<Tip>
  8000 and 6001 can be closed when accessing Coolify through a domain.
</Tip>

- Reverse Proxy: `80, 443` (optional)

<Warning>
  If you are using `Oracle Cloud Free ARM Server`, you need to allow these ports
  inside Oracle's Dashboard, otherwise you cannot reach your instance from the
  internet after installation.
</Warning>

- For GitHub integration, check [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-githubs-ip-addresses).

## Cloud version

If you need the public facing IPs to allow inbound connections to your servers, here is an up-to-date list of IPs that you can use to whitelist:
